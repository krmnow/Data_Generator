The application generates a random 300 first and last names from a pool of 50 first names and 50 surnames stored in the files FirstName.txt and LastName.txt.
The data from the last generation is visible at the input of the box. After clicking "Generate" they are replaced with the next data set. Then they can be saved to a txt file.
Unfortunately, due to a problem with the dll on the local computer, I changed the save system from XLS to txt.
After data generation in the same program session, it is not possible to generate another data set.
Errors and basic events are logged to the log.txt file
